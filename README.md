Math and visualization toolkit for Scala

STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

This Scala library has the aim to extend Scala's (and Java's) native math, data processing and data visualization capabilities to make it easy to work on scientific tasks with the programming language family of Java. Mainly it's purpose is to solve, visualize and automate my math and algorithm homeworks :)
